Answer One:

select a.UserName, count(b.ID) as loginCount from [Users] a, [Users_AccessLog] b where (DATEADD(hour, 10, b.LoginDate) between '20150701' and '20150731') and b.UserId = a.Id group by a.UserName order by loginCount desc;

Answer Two:

SET IDENTITY_INSERT [dbo].[Users] ON

insert into [dbo].[Users] ([Id], [UserName], [Password], [PasswordReminder], [PasswordEncryptType], [IsActive], [Created], [LastLogin], [OpenID], [UpdateCache], [RequirePasswordReset]) values (18886, N's18886', NULL, NULL, 0, 1, CAST(N'2017-03-22 07:19:12.020' AS DateTime), CAST(N'2017-03-22 07:20:12.020' AS DateTime), NULL, 1, 0)
insert into [dbo].[JobSeekers] ([EntityId], [UserId], [FirstName], [LastName], [ContactDetailsId], [ExternalId], [IsProvisioned], [CardID], [IsDeceased], [AcceptedTermsDate], [PrimaryEmailID], [BackupEmailID]) values (41892, 18886, N'Marco', N'Zheng', 25145, N'626484157689', 0, NULL, 0, '20170322', 15080, 32007)
insert into [dbo].[Users_Labels] values (18886, 151)
insert into [dbo].[Users_AccessLog](Userid, LoginDate, IpAddress) VALUES (18886, '20170322', '192.168.0.2')

SET IDENTITY_INSERT [dbo].[Users] OFF

Email Response:

Dear John Barama,

Thank you for letting us know about your recent unhappy experience with CareerHub. 
We apologize that our service did not meet your expectations.

After receiving your email, we immediately looked into the issue you mentioned about.
We found the delay may have been caused because of the automatic restriction system 
set up by the third party service provider when we exceed the maximum number of emails sent. 
Although the daily limit is reset every 24 hours, it still didn't finish sending all the mail on time. 

We have communicated with the provider and asked them to increase the limit temporarily to ensure that 
all mail is sent this week. Also,We have looked into this matter by considering increasing the daily 
email maximum limit to avoid the similar issues happening again. However, the process may take up to 
2 to 5 working days. Also, this kind of problems can be alerted before they are issues. Because we could
not know the appropriate value for the limit, so if it is exceeded next time, we are afraid that you may pay 
for the next upgrade.

Again, we highly appreciate your feedback as it will assist us for improving our customer services. 
It’s our responsibly to provide our customers with the satisfactory services so please for free to 
contact us if you have any further questions.

Kind Regards,

John Smith
